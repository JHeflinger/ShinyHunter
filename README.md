# Shiny Hunter

## How to use

### Running a script

Run `run.bat` or run the `shinyhunt.py` python script directly!

The script takes in 1-2 arguments, the first being the filename of the macro you want to run, and the second being `loop` if you want the macro to loop over and over again instead of ending after a single run.

For example, running my gastly hunter macro would look like this:

`./run.bat gastly_hunting.macro loop`

To exit a macro at any time, just hold the `esc` key!

### Creating a macro

#### Conventions
The script will run one line at a time, executing each macro command one at a time. 

Empty lines will be ignored, and any line prefaced with `#` will be ignored and treated as a comment.

Lines prefaced with `>` are conditionals, and will be ignored unless a conditional command successed prior, such as `debug`

#### Commands

| Command | Convention | Description |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| exit | `exit` | Interrupts and quits the program execution |
| wait | `wait <int>` | Pauses the program for `<int>` milliseconds
| standby | `standby <x> <y> <w> <h>` | Pauses the program and checks if the rectangle on your screen defined by `<x> <y> <w> <h>` coordinates is the same color as the 游릴 or 游린 emoji on discord. If it is 游릴, it will continue and run conditional commands. If it is 游린, the macro will quit.
| copy | `copy <x> <y> <w> <h>` | Copies the rectangle image on your screen defined by `<x> <y> <w> <h>` to your clipboard |
| down | `down <left/right>` | Sets the mouse button defined by `left` or `right` to be pressing down |
| up | `up <left/right>` | Sets the mouse button defined by `left` or `right` to be released  |
| move | `move <x> <y>` | moves the mouse position to the position defined by `<x> <y>` |
| debug | `debug <x> <y> <w> <h>` | if the rectangle on your screen defined by `<x> <y> <w> <h>` coordinates is the same color as the 游릱 or 游린 emoji on discord. If it is 游릱, then it will run conditional commands that follow. If it is 游린, then it will exit the program. Otherwise, nothing will happen and macro execution will continue.
| wild | `wild <x> <y> <w> <h>` | if the rectangle on your screen defined by `<x> <y> <w> <h>` coordinates is the same color as the 游릵 or 游린 emoji on discord. If it is 游릵, then it will run conditional commands that follow. If it is 游린, then it will exit the program. Otherwise, nothing will happen and macro execution will continue.
| hotkey | `hotkey <key1> <key2>` | presses the hotkey command series defined by `<key1> <key2>`, e.g. `ctrl v` |
| print | `print <message>` | prints out `<message>` to console. Note that `<message>` must be wrapped in quotes.
| type | `type <message>` | types out `<message>` with your keyboard. Note that `<message>` must be wrapped in quotes.
| save | `save <x> <y> <w> <h>` | saves the image rectangle defined by `<x> <y> <w> <h>` to an `images/` folder located at the same directory where the program was run in.
| press | `press <key> <int>` | presses the key defined by `<key>` for `<int>` milliseconds
| click | `click <left/right> <x> <y>` | clicks the mouse button defined by `left` or `right` at the location defined by `<x> <y>`
| check | `check <pokemon> <x> <y> <w> <h>` | checks if a shiny pokemon defined by `<pokemon>` is in the image rectangle defined by `<x> <y> <w> <h>` |

Note that the `check` command only supports looking at a 3x horde of gastly at the moment.
